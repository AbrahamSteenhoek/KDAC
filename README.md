# KDAC
Keychain-sized DAC based on [Erik Soosalu's GrubDAC](http://www.diyforums.org/GrubDAC/GrubDACoverview.php)

The schematic is taken almost entirely from Soosalu's design, but the PCB layout has been modified to fit a smaller "key-chain sized" form factor.

Uses a USB C connector instead of USB-mini B
